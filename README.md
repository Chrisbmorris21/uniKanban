University Assignment Tracker Kanban using HTML &amp; Javascript

Those who know Kanban know it is a useful workflow management system. In my mind, the best way to demonstrate understanding of something is to build it. There are a lot of varying Kanban software and apps out there I could sue, but by commencing on this small project, it will allow me to put into real case uses some of my skills across HTML, CSS & Javascript and create a tool I can use for my studies. 

# Rules! #
* **No Frameworks!** The aim of this is to write code and understand the fundamentals without introducing additional libraries or frameworks. It will also demonstrate my organisational skills more clearly if I am forced to think about the order of my files.
* **No Downloaded Libraries!** I personally like to create seperate files to store my objects in so I can bring them in cleanly as necessary. I am aware by default bringing over some external functions from a series of modules is by its defenition utilising a library, so I will be clear that I will only be using libraries that I make myself on this occasion.
* **NO PHP** This is the hardest part for me. I absolutely adore everything about PHP, it was one of the first languages I learnt and holds a special place in my heart. Reluctantly though, this project would be built too quickly if I used it, and would detract from my ability to learn more from javascript. So local files only, no servers, no PHP :(
* **NO MYSQLi** For the same reason, hooking into a database would take the fun out of this. Local Arrays and lists it is!

* **It must be pretty** Kanban is by design a visible workflow, and it's strength is this visibility. I will want to make this be something I actually awntt o look at, otherwise what's the point!

* **No scrolling** The entire app should be within a fullscreen window with no browser based horizontal or vertical scrolling

## Brief ##
Create a small workflow management tool following the core principles of Kanban. The above rules must be satisfied. GO!

What can I break Kanban down to be in its simplest form? 4 lists of data is probably the simplest way I can break it down. Here's a bit of pseudo to get the oils going.

```

list0:[task 0, task 1], list1:[task 2, task 3], list2:[task 4, task 5], list3:[task 6, task 7]

```
And that is the general premise behind Kanban.
