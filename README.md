University Assignment Tracker Kanban using HTML &amp; Javascript

Those who know Kanban know it is a useful workflow management system. In my mind, the best way to demonstrate understanding of something is to build it. There are a lot of varying Kanban software and apps out there I could sue, but by commencing on this small project, it will allow me to put into real case uses some of my skills across HTML, CSS & Javascript and create a tool I can use for my studies. 

# Rules! #
* **No Frameworks!** The aim of this is to write code and understand the fundamentals without introducing additional libraries or frameworks. It will also demonstrate my organisational skills more clearly if I am forced to think about the order of my files.
* **No Downloaded Libraries!** I personally like to create seperate files to store my objects in so I can bring them in cleanly as necessary. I am aware by default bringing over some external functions from a series of modules is by its defenition utilising a library, so I will be clear that I will only be using libraries that I make myself on this occasion.
* **NO PHP** This is the hardest part for me. I absolutely adore everything about PHP, it was one of the first languages I learnt and holds a special place in my heart. Reluctantly though, this project would be built too quickly if I used it, and would detract from my ability to learn more from javascript. So local files only, no servers, no PHP :(
* **NO MYSQLi** For the same reason, hooking into a database would take the fun out of this. Local Arrays and lists it is!

* **It must be pretty** Kanban is by design a visible workflow, and it's strength is this visibility. I will want to make this be something I actually awntt o look at, otherwise what's the point!

* **No scrolling** The entire app should be within a fullscreen window with no browser based horizontal or vertical scrolling

## Brief ##
Create a small workflow management tool following the core principles of Kanban. The above rules must be satisfied. GO!


# Start #

The completed app should allow or the following:

* The user will be able to input a task which isn't shown by default but automatically moves over to the 'To Do' column once bandwiwdth becomes available.
* When the task reaches the 'Completed', it drops off into a completed section which isn't shown by default but can be viewed.
* The user can delete tasks
* the user can edit tasks
* the user can push a task forward
* the user can push a task backward
* the tasks should have a log of what happened to it

So I have typed up the preqrequisites that the Kanban app should allow me to do. I will now re read them, and see if there is anything I would change before commencing the drawings.

# Amendments #
I will pop any additional feature ideas here that I feel may serve m in the future.
* I will have the tasks automatically populate a To Do list and show it. The nature of seeing whats in the To Do will act as a visual stimulant to encourage progress.
* Difficulty gauge. Althoguh this is qualitative, I will be the only user so there will be no risk of miscommunication or misinterpretation
* Reference Source - I can past in a link or directions to a page in a book as a seperate list




# The Task Class #
What information will a task need to hold? wbn = would be nice, but not necessary

* Date
* Title
* Description
* Author
* Category
* Update Log
*  *difficulty gauge - wbn*
*  *reference source - wbn*





```

list0:[task 0, task 1], list1:[task 2, task 3], list2:[task 4, task 5], list3:[task 6, task 7]

```
And that is the general premise behind Kanban.

It's not Disneyland (guess the movie) but the colors give me a rough idea of what I'm shooting for. Everything is easily seperated. I have split the CSS into a few files,
one for the Cards, one will be for the Board, and another for the CRUD buttons. Anyway, this is the evolution of the design. Once I'm happy with how it looks in CSS, I will split up the elements, get them into JS and go from there.
